# Positioning Generator

Positioning Generator is a practical tool for founders, PMs, and content teams to turn fuzzy 
product ideas into clear positioning statements.

I built this as a side project to combine my background in technical writing with [my interest in product marketing](/blog/why-i-built-a-positioning-generator). It also gave me the chance to experiment with prompt engineering, UI flow design, and workflow automation.

<InteractiveButton url="https://positioning-generator.streamlit.app/">
	Launch the app →
</InteractiveButton>

*Note: The app goes to sleep after 12 hours of inactivity. If that happens, just click the **Yes, get this back up!** button and it'll be ready in a moment.*  

## How It Works

1.	**Describe your product**: Start by writing a short description in your own words.
2.	**Generate product insights**: With one click, the app produces an overview of your product's category, competitors, target persona, and differentiators. You can edit these for accuracy and clarity.
3.	**Generate positioning statement**: Once you're happy with the inputs, the app creates a concise, polished positioning statement.

## Behind the Scenes

- Built with Python + Streamlit  
- Powered by the OpenAI SDK for content generation
- Designed for non-developers, with editable outputs and an iterative workflow

## What's Next

The app is currently in beta, and I'm continuing to refine it. Upcoming improvements include:

- Smarter validation and clearer success messaging
- Enhanced output quality with more nuanced prompts
- A cleaner, more polished design
