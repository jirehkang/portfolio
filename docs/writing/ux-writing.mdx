## Overview

As a technical and UX writer at Sendbird, I was responsible for crafting and improving in-product copy across the dashboard to make settings and actions clearer for users. This included writing and refining microcopy for toggle labels, descriptions, tooltips, error messages, and other UI elements.

## Scope of work

- Partnered with a product designer in Figma to align copy with design and user flows.
- Translated technical functionality into clear, actionable language to reduce user friction.
- Maintained consistency and clarity while ensuring alignment with product tone and UX standards.

## Outcome

- Enhanced self-serve usability for users interacting with advanced configuration settings.
- Improved overall UX consistency by applying clear language patterns across similar components.

_Note: The screenshot below highlights examples of the UX copy I wrote for the dashboard._
