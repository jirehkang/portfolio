## Overview

As a technical and UX writer at Sendbird, I was responsible for crafting and improving in-product copy across the dashboard to make settings and actions clearer for users.

## Scope of work

- Wrote and refined microcopy for toggle labels, descriptions, tooltips, and error messages.
- Translated technical behaviors into plain, actionable language.
- Ensured clarity and consistency while aligning with product tone and user expectations.

## Outcome

- Reduced ambiguity in key settings by providing context directly in the UI.
- Improved overall UX consistency by applying clear language patterns across similar components.
- Enhanced self-serve usability for technical users interacting with complex configuration settings.

_Note: The screenshot below highlights examples of the UX copy I wrote for the dashboard._
