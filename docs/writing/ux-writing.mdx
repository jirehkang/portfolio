## Overview

As a technical and UX writer at Sendbird, a SaaS chat solution provider, I was responsible for crafting and improving in-product copy across the dashboard to make actions clearer and more intuitive for users.

## Scope of work

- Wrote and refined copy for UI elements such as tooltips, placeholders, button labels, and form inputs.
- Partnered with the design team in Figma to align copy with design intent and user flows.
- Maintained consistency and clarity while ensuring alignment with product tone and UX standards.

## Outcome

- Enhanced self-serve usability by clarifying key interactions and reducing friction across the dashboard.
- Improved overall UX consistency by applying clear language patterns across similar components.

_Note: The video below highlights examples of the copy I wrote for the dashboard._
