## Overview

As a technical and UX writer at Sendbird, a SaaS chat solution provider, I documented a new feature called Polls, which allows users to create and vote in polls directly within the chat.

_Note: All content was written by me, except for the code samples._

## Scope of Work

- Wrote a comprehensive feature overview and 12 API reference guides for supported actions.
- Ensured technical accuracy by collaborating closely with engineers and product stakeholders and using Postman to test and confirm endpoint behavior under various conditions.

## Outcome

- Deployed the documentation in sync with the feature release, contributing to a smooth developer onboarding experience.
- Led the end-to-end documentation process, from draft to release, maintaining clarity, accuracy, and alignment with company standards.
