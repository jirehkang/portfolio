# Web copywriting

Kim & Chang | February 2020

## Overview

As the content marketing editor at Kim & Chang, Korea's leading law firm, I led the copy development for a full-scale website revamp—writing and editing key pages to clearly communicate the firm's expertise and credibility.

_Note: All content in the above page was written or edited by me. Other pages of the website have been modified since my time at the firm._

## Scope of work

- Wrote and edited copy for core pages, including service descriptions, attorney bios, and navigation menus, ensuring clarity, accessibility, and strategic positioning.
- Edited and structured content for clarity, accessibility, and tone consistency across the site.
- Localized and adapted Korean-language content to suit English-speaking users while preserving nuance and intent.

## Outcome

- Delivered a cohesive and accessible content experience that better served prospective global clients.
- Strengthened the firm's digital presence and reinforced its positioning as a world-class legal advisor through precise, professional web copy.
