Have you ever read a company's marketing page, then opened their docs and wondered if they were even talking about the same product?

That disconnect is where users can get lost. As a technical writer, I've always cared about clarity, accuracy, and helping people succeed. Over time, I've learned that documentation becomes even more powerful when it's connected to a product's positioning and go-to-market (GTM) strategy.

## The Role of Technical Writing in GTM

Technical writers focus on clarity and user success, but our impact grows when we connect our work to the bigger "why" behind a product. When documentation reflects positioning, it does more than explain features. It reinforces the product's value and gives users a consistent experience from discovery to adoption.

In practice, this matters because technical writers serve two audiences:

- **External**: end users who rely on guides, references, and tutorials.
- **Internal**: engineers and support teams who benefit from reduced tickets and smoother onboarding.

By aligning documentation with positioning, both audiences win.

Documentation isn't just supporting material. It's part of the go-to-market strategy.

Marketing drives awareness. Documentation drives adoption and self-service. Together, they deliver a stronger user experience and increase retention.

## Why Positioning Matters

Positioning defines three things:

- The problem your product solves
- The audience it serves
- The differentiators that make it unique

With that foundation, writers can make smarter choices about tone, emphasis, and examples. Documentation stop being isolated instructions and instead echo the same story users see in marketing.

💡 **Tip**

Next time you're writing content that shapes how users understand or adopt a product, take a moment to seek out how your product is positioned. Even a rough sense of the "why" will make your writing sharper and better aligned with business goals.

For example, if a tool is positioned as "built for non-technical teams," your onboarding could highlight visual workflows, drag-and-drop actions, and plain-language explanations that reinforce ease of use.

## Turning Insight Into Action: Building My Own Generator

Recognizing this connection inspired me to create a Positioning Generator app that guides you step by step through the same questions marketers and product teams use when shaping strategy.

The app is live in beta, so I'm still refining the features and design. Click the button below to see the app in action or check out the [Positioning Generator](https://jirehkang.github.io/docs/apps/positioning-generator) page for more details on how it works and how it was built.
